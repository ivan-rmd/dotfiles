Random config files from Ivan
=============================

So far just my `.vimrc` and `.tmux.conf` files

run: `source install.sh`

to install the `.vimrc` file and `.vim` directory.

* Chill bro, a backup will be created.
* Pathogen is included.
* Variety of bundles included as submodules

* `bootstrap` is a list of Ubunut/Debian packages
  for tools that frequently use but are not installed
  by default. Usage: `sudo aptitude instann $(< bootstrap)`
